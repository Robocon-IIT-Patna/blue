An app developed for use by Team Phoenix for competitions as well as students by IIT Patna for coursework, projects and robotics competitions.

This app utilized Bluetooth Communication, supports various bluetooth microcontrollers such as ESP32, Arduino and Raspberry PI. 
We hope this helps the IITP Students in their coursework based projects, Robotics competitions and hobby projects.

This incorporates a custom 2 way command line, voice control and joystick for controlling wheeled robots and drones. If you have any suggestions or face any bugs, 
please contact robocon@iitp.ac.in. Cheers!
