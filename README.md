# Blue

An application developed for Team Phoenix's competitions and utilized by IIT Patna students for coursework, projects, and robotics competitions.

This app employs Bluetooth communication, supporting various Bluetooth microcontrollers such as ESP32, Arduino, and Raspberry PI. We aim to assist IITP students in their coursework projects, robotics competitions, and hobby endeavors.

It features a custom two-way command line, voice control, and joystick for the seamless control of wheeled robots and drones. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please reach out to robocon@iitp.ac.in. Cheers!
